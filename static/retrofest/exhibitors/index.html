    Jonathan (or JP to his friends) is an Embedded Systems developer and Rust
    evangelist by day, but has recently fallen into the world of 1990's UNIX
    hardware and software.

    Bluesky (@thejpster.org.uk) or on Mastodon (thejpster@hachyderm.io). He also
    runs https://thejpster.org.uk, which posts blogs about trains and Rust and
    sometimes his adventures with UNIX workstations.

    B132L+ and HP Visualize C3000. He also owns an Acorn RiscPC 700, Commodore
