<h1>UNIX Desktop Environments at RetroFest 2025</h1>

<p>
    Here are the Desktop Environments you can see in our little UNIX corner of
    RetroFest 2025.
</p>

<h2 id="cde">Common Desktop Environment (CDE)</h2>
<p>
    <i>Running on the <a href="../machines/index.html#c3000">HP 9000 Visualize
    C3000</a>.</i>
</p>
<p>
    The Common Desktop Environment (CDE) was introduced in 1993, as a joint
    effort between HP, IBM, Sun and UNIX System Labs to unify the commercial
    UNIX market. The idea was that a common desktop would make it easier to
    train users, and port applications between the various UNIXes. The result
    was something very ... professional? Boring?
</p>
<p>
    CDE uses the Motif widget toolkit to draw the buttons, text boxes, and so
    on, and the Motif window manager to draw the window frames, maximise /
    minimise controls, and so on.
</p>
<p>
    The last major release was in 1997, although it continued to be supported
    long after. Both CDE and Motif were released as open source in 2012. If you
    have Linux, You could try writing Motif applications yourself!
</p>

<h2 id="magic">Silicon Graphics Indigo Magic Desktop</h2>
<p>
    <i>Running on the <a href="../machines/index.html#indigo2">Silicon Graphics
    Power Indigo 2</a>.</i>
</p>
<p>
    Silicon Graphics' IRIX operating system started shipping the Indigo Magic
    Desktop with IRIX 5.1 in 1993. It replaced an earlier desktop called IRIS
    WorkSpace. Indigo Magic Desktop was renamed to IRIX Interactive Desktop in
    1998, and continues on today as a desktop for Linux called the MaXX
    Interactive Desktop.
</p>
<p>
    As you use Indigo Magic Desktop you'll notice it has sounds and animations
    that set it apart from other UNIX desktop environments. It even has 'modern'
    ideas like an icon on the desktop for the CD-ROM drive that changes when a
    CD is inserted. Indigo Magic Desktop uses the Motif widget toolkit, just
    like CDE. The default window manager is 4Dwm. 
</p>

<h2 id="openwindows">Sun OpenWindows</h2>
<p>
    <i>Running on the <a href="../machines/index.html#ultra80">Sun Ultra
    80</a>.</i>
</p>
<p>
    I don't know much about Sun OpenWindows. It was replaced by CDE.
</p>

<h2 id="vue">HP Visual User Environment (VUE)</h2>
<p>
    <i>Running on the <a href="../machines/index.html#b132l">HP 9000 Visualize
    B132L+</a>.</i>
</p>
<p>
    If you think HP VUE looks a bit like CDE, well that's because
    HP donated much of the Vue desktop to the CDE project (whilst Sun supplied
    applications like the Calendar). HP VUE uses the Motif widget toolkit.
</p>
<p>
    VUE started at Apollo Computer in 1998, running on their Domain/OS. Apollo
    were purchased by HP in 1989 and VUE 2.0 was released with HP-UX 8, and VUE
    3.0 with <a href="../operating-systems/index.html#hpux">HP-UX</a> 9 and 10.
    By the time HP-UX 11 came along in 1997, the only desktop included was CDE.
