I hit BUY at JLCPCB, and ordered:

* 30 off Rev 1.0.0 (using up all the SMD parts I had pre-purchased and had JLC stash away for me)
* 25 off Expansion Card Template v0.7.0

Let's hope they work! If you want to buy one, get in touch and I'll see what I can do. Or order your own using the files at <https://github.com/Neotron-Compute/Neotron-Pico/releases>
