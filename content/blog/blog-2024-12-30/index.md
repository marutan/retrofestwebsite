## Intro

It's been a busy year, so for my own edification, I wanted to record all the events I've attended this year.

It's a long list and it's taken me away from home a lot, so I'm committing to attend far fewer in 2025. In fact hopefully I will only attend two events next year.

## Rust Nation

* Location: London, England
* Date: 27-28 March, 2024
* Travel: Train to/from London

A two day conference in London, I commuted from home. I presented a 1-hour
workshop on using Ferrocene and the differences between libcore and libstd.

## Embedded World

* Location: Nuremberg, Germany
* Date: 9-11 April, 2024
* Travel: N/A

I got very sick shortly after Rust Nation, and so couldn't attend this event,
unfortunately.

## RustNL

* Location: Delft, Netherlands
* Date: 6-10 May, 2024
* Travel: Eurostar to/from Rotterdam

A two day conference in Delft, followed by a Rust Embedded Devices Working Group
meeting. At the conference, I hosted a round-table on the Industry track.

## VECS

* Location: Gothenburg, Sweden
* Date: 13-16 May
* Travel: Flew RyanAir Stansted - Gothenburg, and back

I was running the stand at this automotive industry trade show. I stayed at the
Lisberg, which was an amazing hotel and almost completely empty due to an
unfortunately incident at the theme park.

## University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest

* Location: Bucharest, Romania
* Date: 25-27 May, 2024
* Travel: Flew RyanAir Stansted - Bucharest

I visted the University to talk to the students who are learning Embedded
Systems using Rust. This trip was supported by NXP.

## Oxidize Conference

* Location: Berlin, Germany
* Date: 28-30 May, 2024
* Travel
  * Flew Bucharest to Berlin via Vienna on Air Austria
  * Returned on EuroSleeper to Brussels, Eurostar to London, and a train home

I presented a one-day workshop on Ferrocene.

## Client meeting

* Location: Stuttgart, Germany
* Date: June, 2024
* Travel: Flew RyanAir Stansted - Stuttgart, and back

The flight back got in late so I stayed the night in London.

## RustConf

* Location: Montreal, Candada
* Date: 10-14 September, 2024
* Travel: Train to/from London, Elizabeth Line to/from Heathrow, Air Canada to Montreal and back

A two day conference, where I presented a talk on Video on the Neotron Pico. I flew back on the red-eye late on Friday, arriving Saturday. Friday was spent wandering around the old docks in Montreal.

## Ferrous Systems' All-Hands

* Date: 15-20 September, 2024
* Travel: Train to/from Stansted, RyanAir to Berlin, and back

Company meetings, and a day recording video content.

## EuroRust

* Location: Vienna, Austria
* Date: 9-12 October, 2024
* Travel: Train to/from Gatwick, Whizzair to/from Vienna

A two day conference, where I presented a talk on SD Cards. This was the day [the railway line at Stevenage caught fire](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly373r7pg3o), so I had a nightmare trying to get to Gatwick. I won't use Gatwick again because the ThamesLink Class 700 is miserable to sit on for two hours.
