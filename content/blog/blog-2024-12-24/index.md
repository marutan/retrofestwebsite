## Intro

Amstrad always wanted to have a 'killer product' out for Christmas. Before home computers it might have been a CB Radio, or something like that, but between 1984 and 1995, their big Christmas product was usually some kind of home computer. These were normally announced in July-September, in time to ramp up sales for the Christmas rush.
