Well it's been a busy year. I was made Deputy Mayor of St Ives back in May 2019 and that has rather filled up the calendar. I also present Monotron at ACCU 2019 in Bristol, and again at RustFest 2019 in Portland, Oregon. You can checkout the videos below:

I've also spent a lot of time thinking about interfaces on old computers systems - floppy drives, IDE, SCSI, Parallel Ports and more. This then lead to an idea for a more expandable Monotron which, with some help from @altsegcat, turned into a thing called the Neotron. More on that next time...
