I'm about to try and drive a 4.3" Display-Tech LCD from my Cortex-M4 powered Stellaris Launchpad board.

Yes, this is a different LCD to the one I mentioned previously. I bought two 2.8" cheap and nasty eBay specials and one arrived cracked and the other wouldn't respond to some test code using uTFT. I gave up and decided to buy something a little more professional. Sadly, I seem to have bought the last one RS are ever going to stock. I hope I don't break it.

Anyway, in preparation, I've enabled PLL support and added an option to clock the chip at 66.67MHz. I have a feeling that's going to be helpful later on.

See my [github](https://github.com/thejpster/launchpad).
