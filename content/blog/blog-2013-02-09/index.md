My Github for the Stellaris Launchpad has had a cleanup. I've dropped support for using the ARM-Linux compiler as building without a C-library rapidly gets boring. The baremetal ARM compiler is a straightforward enough install (you unpack the tarball).

The linker script has become more complicated, but I've tried to explain what (I think) it all does.
