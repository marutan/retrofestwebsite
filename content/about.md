# About Me

I am a husband and father of two, living in the town of St Ives, Cambridgeshire, England.

We have two cats and a dog. I have a a growing collection of old computers, including:

* Commodore 128D
   * JiffyDOS (for C128, C64 and 1571)
   * External Pi1541
   * CGA to SCART adaptor
* Apple Macintosh LC II
   * Apple Colour Monitor
   * SCSI2SD
   * PDS Ethernet Card
   * External MediaVision Reno SCSI CD-ROM
   * StyleWriter II
* Amstrad PCW9512
   * 3" CF2DD Drive A:
   * Gotek Drive B:
   * Daisywheel Printer
* BBC Micro Model B
   * BeebMMC SD Card interface
* Sega MegaDrive
* Microsoft Xbox
* Nintendo Wii
   * With Gamecube memory module and controllers
* Sony Playstation 2
* Sony Playstation 3
* Sony Playstation 4

I succesfully stood for election to [St Ives Town Council](https://www.stivestowncouncil.gov.uk) as an Independent in 2016 and again in 2018. In 2019 my fellow Town Councillors elected me as Deputy Town Mayor, and in 2020 as Town Mayor.

For my day job, I have spent over 15 years as an Embedded Systems Consultant for several Cambridge based product design consultancies. I am currently working at [42 Technology](https://42technology.com) in St Ives.

## **Personal Projects**

### Rust

I have been a huge fan of the Rust programming language since the 1.0 days. As part of this, I produced some [workshop material](https://github.com/thejpster/pi-workshop-rs) for the Raspberry Pi Party 2017. I've also delivered several Embedded Rust training workshops, and it's been a key theme of my projects over the last five years.

### Monotron

I wanted to make a 1980s style home computer using an inexpensive Cortex-M4 devkit. Can you generate VGA from this board? In colour? How about handle a PS/2 keyboard? Load applications? Let the user write BASIC programs? Generate audio? More importantly, can you do all this in pure Embedded Rust, with no C or C++ in sight? The result was The Monotron, a small single-board computer inspired by early CP/M and MS-DOS machines. This was presented at several tech conferences, including [Rust Fest Paris (2018)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTEYqpcQ6lg&t=2s), [Rust Belt Rust (2018)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBRFtlT5Pfs&t=33s), [ACCU 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmjqAhRtvHI) and [RustConf (2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXaSUiGgyEw).

You can see more on my [Github](https://github.com/thejpster/monotron).

### Neotron

Monotron has been followed by Neotron - a family of Arm Cortex-M powered systems which share an OS, through the use of a custom BIOS acting as a hardware abstraction layer.

You can see more at <https://github.com/neotron-compute>.

### Grease

With a background in Telecoms firmware which use a strict layered message-passing approach to stack implementation, I wrote a proof-of-concept message-passing framework in Rust, called Grease (because it makes rusty threads work more easily).

The source code is [on Github](https://github.com/thejpster/grease) 

### Beagleboard X15

I wrote a pure-Rust firmware for the Cortex-M4 sub-system in the Texas Instruments AM5874 SoC found on the Beagleboard X15. This implemented VirtIO vrings and could exchange messages with a C or Rust user-space application on the Linux/Cortex-A side via a socket.

The source code is [on Github](https://github.com/thejpster/rust-beagleboardx15-demo)
